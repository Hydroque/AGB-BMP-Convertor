Your first step is to have Java JDK. This program should be compiled under at least 1.7 JDK. The latest as of now is JDK 1.8.
Download this from Oracle, or use OpenJDK, but rather use Oracle.

To actually use this file, you will need Java's BIN in your path (environment variables). This should be done automatically,
if not, append it to your PATH.

Use the following command format to build.

javac [name].java
(Example: javac Main.java)

This will build it. Alternatively, you can plug this into an eclipse project, save it, and it should build automatically.
Then you just have to find the file in your workspace.

Use the following command format to run.

java [name without extension]
(Example: java Main)

Please note your CMD should be cd'd to your directory in wish you want to use this. Java lacks the PATH environment variable
when it looks up the file to run. So, only if your source/class you are trying to javac or java is in the immediate directory
or javac/java's bin folder will these two exe's work.
